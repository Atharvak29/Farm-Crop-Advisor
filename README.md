# üåæ Smart Farm Advisor

An intelligent decision-support system that recommends the most suitable crop based on **soil**, **district**, **season**, and **water requirement** ‚Äî empowering farmers and agri-businesses to make informed, data-driven crop selection decisions.

A dashboard app to get advice and necessary statistics to decide a crop will suite your needs

## üöÄ Project Overview

Agriculture faces challenges like fluctuating weather, soil degradation, and uncertain market demand. Our system leverages **machine learning** on real agri-market and soil data to:

* Recommend the best crop to cultivate in given conditions
* Optimize productivity, reduce risk, and maximize profitability
* Empower farmers with smart agri-decision tools

**Tech Stack:**

* Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
* Streamlit (for user-friendly web app)
* Machine Learning (Decision Trees)

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used contains real-world agricultural market and soil parameters:

| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| District                      | Name of district (e.g., Pune, Nashik)     |
| APMC\_Name                    | Agriculture Produce Market Committee Name |
| Commodity                     | Crop name (target variable)               |
| Arrival\_Quantity\_Qtl        | Quantity of crop arrived in market (Qtl)  |
| Modal\_Price\_Rs\_Qtl         | Modal price (Rs/Qtl)                      |
| Soil\_Type                    | Loam, Sandy etc.                          |
| Water\_Requirement            | Low, Medium etc.                          |
| Season                        | Kharif, Rabi                              |
| Average\_Yield\_Tons\_per\_Ha | Yield                                     |
| Typical\_Costs\_Rs\_per\_Ha   | Cost of production                        |
| Export\_Potential             | High, Medium, Low                         |

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

‚úÖ Crop recommendation based on soil, water, and district  ‚úÖ Simple, interactive Streamlit web interface  ‚úÖ Easy-to-interpret Decision Tree model  ‚úÖ Export potential insights for market-driven decisions  ‚úÖ Scalable framework to integrate larger datasets

## üìà Model Architecture

We trained a **Decision Tree Classifier** on encoded categorical features (District, Soil, Season, Water). The model predicts the **Commodity** most suitable under the given conditions.

### Key Steps:

* Data preprocessing and label encoding
* Feature selection: District, Soil\_Type, Season, Water\_Requirement
* Model training and evaluation
* Deployment via Streamlit app

## üß† Research Impact & Capabilities

This project demonstrates:

* **Applied Machine Learning in Agriculture**: Bridging the gap between agri-expertise and data science
* **Feature Importance Analysis**: Understanding key factors influencing crop suitability
* **Decision Support System Design**: Translating research into actionable tools for end-users
* **Scalability Potential**: Framework adaptable to integrate weather, market prices, and geospatial data in future iterations

## What‚Äôs missing / To be added (for accuracy + completeness)
|Gap / Missing Item	|Reason it‚Äôs needed	|Suggestion|
|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
|Suitability Score is random (not from model)|	Currently assigning random suitability score np.random.randint(70,100) | Use actual model prediction probability (normalized as %)|
|Real time weather api missing	| Currently using random Temerature, Rainfall, Humidity | Integrate weather api to get best predictions|
|Real District names insted of numbers| User can't understand what state they are choosing| Endcode the data properly or showcase a tables vs the encoded value for user reference|
|ETL Framework missing | Make a etl pipline that extracts data for real time data decision | Run a cronjob every data and fetch essesntial data from government website|

---

## üìå Future Work

* Integrate real-time weather and market data
* Deploy advanced models (Random Forests, XGBoost)
* Enhance UI/UX and multilingual support
* Collaborate with agri-research bodies for larger datasets
* Implement mobile app
